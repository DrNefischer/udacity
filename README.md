# Udacity Nanodegree Programms

This is a github repro for the Udacity Nanodegree Programms I haven taken in 2021. It includes all the graded projects. In case you have a question feel free to contact me.

Udacity has a lot of more interessting courses and the options are endless. My goal was to get fast into Data Science and Machine Learning while also understanding the theory behind it. I therefor selected the following courses. The cumulative effort for the courses is 26 months (based on 10hrs/week). I guess thats about one term at university. 
Without any discount that would have been 9300€ (with discount, diligence and hopefully tax it will be about 270€), which is actually way more than the price of a fuel master degree at GA tech: [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu).

Note: Udacity reviewers give very useful feedback even after successfully passing a project. I am still implementing most of it.

- Capstone: Dog Project

### AIND: Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (nd898)
__Recommended time:__ 3 months, __Level:__ Advanced, __Perequisite:__ Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, & Python

The course is based around the book by Peter Norvig who also gives a lot of the lectures within the programm:
* English: [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://amzn.to/3x9zn09)
* German: [Künstliche Intelligenz: Ein moderner Ansatz](https://amzn.to/3jaDqVx)

At the end of the course Udacity recommends to take the Deep Learning,  Deep Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Programm. 

#### Projects
- Build a Sudoku Solver
