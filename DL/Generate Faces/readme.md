# Project: Generate Faces

## Review:

A few resources to further boost your knowledge in this area:

* To gain more intuition about GANs in general, I would suggest you take a look at [this blog post](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/abusing-generative-adversarial-networks-to-make-8-bit-pixel-art-e45d9b96cee7).
* If you want to gain intuition about convolution and transpose convolution arithmetic, I would suggest referring to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285).
* For more advanced techniques on training GANs, you can refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498).
* You might have seen that reduction in loss and the quality of images do not track closely which is unlike other networks that we have seen earlier. To create a GAN that has this relationship that lower loss will result in better images, take a look at [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875). This GAN is based on a different loss function which is known as Wasserstein Loss.
* GAN is a prominent area of research. You can keep track of the new techniques introduced in this category [here](https://paperswithcode.com/methods/category/generative-adversarial-networks).
