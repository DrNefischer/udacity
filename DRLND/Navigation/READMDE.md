# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning - Projet 1

This is my solution of Project 1 Navigation for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree by Udacity. 

## Workspace 
If you want to run my implementation or maybe even want to solve the project yourself its best to start at the official github by Udacity:
* [Udacity Workspace](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md)

## Q-Network
Difficult? Well, not if you followed the course. There we learned about Deep Q-network(DQN). The course explained in detail how to use it, I can highly recommend it and implement the DQN yourself. Again you can find the source code at the official github:
* [Udacity DQN Exercice](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/dqn)

## Implementation
The solution now is very simple. We just need to adopt the DQN to interact with the given environment of the unity engine. Just look at my code and the comments. 
I set a limit of the training score at 13. I only once reached 14 and nearly ran out of gpu time.
