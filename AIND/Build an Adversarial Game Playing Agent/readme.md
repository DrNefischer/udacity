The reviewer recommended to read the following documents:
* [Search Heuristics for Isolation](http://ajulio.com/assets/documents/Adversarial_Game.pdf) in which the results of the application of 7 different heuristics were presented using alpha-beta pruning with iterative depth against different opponents who use different algorithms in the Isolation game.
* [A Survey of Monte Carlo Tree Search Methods.](http://www.incompleteideas.net/609%20dropbox/other%20readings%20and%20resources/MCTS-survey.pdf)
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling.
* [Improving Opening Book Performance Through Modeling of Chess Opponents.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221476487_Improving_Opening_Book_Performance_Through_Modeling_of_Chess_Opponents)
* [This document](http://www.fierz.ch/strategy2.htm) for example talks on strategy game programming. In it we see principal variation search and killer moves.
* More on killer heuristic and other heuristics can be found [here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-History-Heuristic-and-Alpha-Beta-Search-in-Schaeffer/b4d2cf76e4c42b9325b52aac45d61e80a01de77b?p2df)
* For the algorithm of principal variation search, this [link to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_variation_search) provides the pseudocode.
* In [this document](https://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2015/09/intro-to-monte-carlo-tree-search/) we see some details on Monte Carlo Tree Search.
* [In this article](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html), you will see whether you should go for speed or accuracy.
* Finally, in this [document](http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~jiarong/paper/paper-jiang-inferning12.pdf) you will see how and when to prioritize between speed and accuracy.
* [This document](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/271fall09/Games271f09.pdf) provide more info on the relationship between the time and depth and how they influence the result.
