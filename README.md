# Udacity Nanodegree Programms

This is a github repro for the Udacity Nanodegree Programms I haven taken in 2021. It includes all the graded projects. In case you have a question feel free to contact me.

The cumulative effort for the courses is 21 months (based on 10hrs/week). I guess thats about one term at university.
Udacity has a lot of more interessting courses. My goal was to get fast into Data Science and Machine Learning while also understanding the theory behind it.
I therefor selected the following courses.

### DAND: Data Analyst Nanodegree (nd002)
Recommended time: 4 months, Level: Intermediate

At the end of the course Udacity recommends to take the Data Scientist Nanodegree Programm. 

#### Projects
- Explore Weather Trends
- Data Visualization

### DSND: Data Scientist Nanodegree (nd025)
Recommended time: 4 months, Level: Advanced

The Data Scientist Nanodegree program builds on the foundation of the Data Analyst Nanodegree to teach the following skills that companies look for in Data Scientist job candidates:
* Knowledge of how to build supervised machine learning models and making data-driven solutions
* Strong understanding of neural networks, deep learning, and PyTorch
* Ability to build unsupervised machine learning models
* Software engineering and data engineering skills
* Knowledge of how to design experiments and analyze A/B test results.

#### Projects
- Data Science Blog Post
- Disaster Response Pipeline
- Recommendations with IBM
- Dog Project

### AIND: Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (nd898)
Recommended time: 3 months, Level: Advanced

The course is based around the book by Peter Norvig who also gives a lot of the lectures withinthe programm:
* [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://amzn.to/3x9zn09)
* [KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz: Ein moderner Ansatz](https://amzn.to/3jaDqVx)

At the end of the course Udacity recommends to take the Deep Learning,  Deep Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Programm. 

#### Projects
- Build a Sudoku Solver
- Build a Forward-Planning Agent
- Build an Adversarial Game Playing Agent
- Part of Speech Tagging

### DL: Deep Learning (nd101)
Recommended time: 4 months, Level: Intermediate

The course recommends the book by Andrew Trask who also gives a lecture within the programm:
* [Grokking Deep Learning](https://amzn.to/3qqyD3R)
* [Neuronale Netze und Deep Learning kapieren: Der einfache Praxiseinstieg mit Beispielen in Python](https://amzn.to/3jf0Clt)

The Deep Learning Nanodegree program introduces key techniques powering many of the most exciting recent advances in AI. You'll learn about various network architectures and applications, with an emphasis on real-world applications.

### DRLND: Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree (nd893)
Recommended time: 3 months, Level: Advanced

The course recommends the book by Miguel Morales who also gives a lecture within the programm:
* [Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://amzn.to/3A0gEWD)

The Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program teaches how to train AI agents to perform a variety of complex tasks.

### MLE: Machine Learning Engineer (nd009-ent)
Recommended time: 3 months, Level: Intermediate

The Machine Learning Nanodegree program teaches a variety of techniques for modeling real-world data that can be used as standalone products or as part of an end-to-end AI system.
