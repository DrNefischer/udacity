## Data Analysis
"If you feel like you are being thrown in the deep end with data wrangling and exploratory analysis, we recommend you seriously consider taking a step back and pursuing the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND). If you arenâ€™t drowning, but struggling, then consider the following individual courses:"

## Videos
"Because the video material for this Nanodegree (ND) is taken from multiple existing Udacity courses, it can seem jarring at times, or missing material. One great option is to just simply watch the entire video series, in their original format, as Udacity Classes."
