Tips for the Machine Learning Nanodegree taken from https://github.com/machinelearningnanodegree/MLND/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks

## Data Analysis
"If you feel like you are being thrown in the deep end with data wrangling and exploratory analysis, we recommend you seriously consider taking a step back and pursuing the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND). If you arenâ€™t drowning, but struggling, then consider the following individual courses:"
* [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170): Data Analysis Using NumPy and Pandas
* [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359): Learn What It Takes to Become a Data Scientist
* [Data Wrangling with MongoDB by mongoDB](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032): Data Manipulation and Retrieval

## Videos
"Because the video material for this Nanodegree (ND) is taken from multiple existing Udacity courses, it can seem jarring at times, or missing material. One great option is to just simply watch the entire video series, in their original format, as Udacity Classes."
* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120): Pattern Recognition for Fun and Profit
* [Machine Learning by Gorgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning--ud262): Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement
* [Reinforcement Learning by Gorgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600): Offered at Georgia Tech as CS 8803
