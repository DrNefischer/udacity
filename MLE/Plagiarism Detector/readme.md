# Project: Plagiarism Detector

## Review:
* Now you've seen how SageMaker works. It's really intended for large-scale projects, since it can [auto-scale](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/endpoint-auto-scaling.html). AWS just came out with a lot of new features as well with SageMaker; check out [this video](https://youtu.be/7-31KgImGgU?t=5402) for more. Best of luck with the rest of the nanodegree!
* I think map may be the fastest; [see this post for an example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48717353/4549682). In general, you shouldn't use apply (read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54432584/4549682)), since you can accomplish most tasks much faster with map, reduce, lambda functions, or other built-in pandas functions. However, if you must use apply, I recommend using the [swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter) library.
* ctually, the correlation value of 0.88 between c1 and c5 that you chose is a high correlation value - anything above 0.7 is [generally considered a strong correlation](http://www.dmstat1.com/res/TheCorrelationCoefficientDefined.html), some even say above 0.6 is [strong](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat200/node/67). I only used LCS as a feature when I did the project, although now you need to select 3 features as a requirement. Selecting too many features is actually not good due to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality).
* One way to improve your analysis is with a confusion matrix. To get a confusion matrix (which gives the false positives and negatives), you can use something like [this](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/plotting/plot_confusion_matrix/) from mlxtend, and other methods from the sklearn and yellowbrick packages. It will allow you to quickly see the number of false positives and negatives, and true positives and negatives.
